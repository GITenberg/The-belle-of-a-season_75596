      <div class='line'>Expect not, gentle readers, here to find</div>
      <div class='line'>Some wild romance,—effusion of a mind</div>
      <div class='line'>Imbued with pictures, which dark fancies give;—</div>
      <div class='line'>My Heroine, like yourselves doth act and live.</div>
      <div class='line'>No scenes of terror here you’ll see portrayed,</div>
      <div class='line'>To shock the feelings of a timid maid.</div>
      <div class='line'>No scowling wretches here with purpose dire,</div>
      <div class='line'>With dark-laid plots and fiendlike men conspire.</div>
      <div class='line'>No women, who, forgetful of their sex,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yielding to passion’s sway, their hearts perplex.</div>
      <div class='line'>No tyrant father, and no mother cross;</div>
      <div class='line'>No gamester desperate with heavy loss.</div>
      <div class='line'>No rivals using every wicked art,</div>
      <div class='line'>To rob a damsel of her lover’s heart.</div>
      <div class='line'>No murderous dagger, and no poisoned cup,</div>
      <div class='line'>To make pale readers full on horrors sup.</div>
      <div class='line'>No sinful love here marks its guilty course,</div>
      <div class='line'>Followed by shame, remorse, and a divorce.</div>
      <div class='line'>No ruined château, and no gliding ghost,</div>
      <div class='line'>No duel or elopement, can we boast</div>
      <div class='line'>In these poor pages, only meant to shew</div>
      <div class='line'>The scenes of real life, whose truth you know.</div>
      <div class='line'>My Heroine, like yourselves, devoid of art,</div>
      <div class='line'>Rich in each gift of person, mind, and heart;—</div>
      <div class='line'>Just such a daughter as all parents prize,</div>
      <div class='line'>And just as you appear to the fond eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>Of yours;—just such a nymph as men adore:</div>
      <div class='line'>Look in your glass—her image stands before.</div>
      <div class='line'>The tresses may present a different hue,</div>
      <div class='line'>The eyes may gray or black be, ’stead of blue;</div>
      <div class='line'>More or less <em>embonpoint</em> perhaps you’ll see,</div>
      <div class='line'>But, ne’ertheless, mankind will all agree</div>
      <div class='line'>That beauties are as sisters like: ’tis true,</div>
      <div class='line'>When Mary I described—I thought of you.</div>
      <div class='line'>The same your winning charms, your dimples, smiles,</div>
      <div class='line'>The same mild virtue that each heart beguiles,</div>
      <div class='line'>The same your occupations, hopes, and fears,</div>
      <div class='line'>Your artless gaiety, your ready tears;—</div>
      <div class='line'>You’ll recognise the portrait I am sure,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though you deny it with a look demure:</div>
      <div class='line'>And thus alike in loveliness and lives,</div>
      <div class='line'>May you, like Mary, soon be blessed as—wives.</div>

      <div class='line'>Hath breathed her sweetness through the air</div>
      <div class='line'>That murmurs o’er the bright parterre;</div>
      <div class='line'>On many a forest-monarch tall</div>
      <div class='line'>Hath hung a fresh green coronal—</div>
      <div class='line'>The emerald turf hath dressed anew,</div>
      <div class='line'>With primrose pale, and violet blue;</div>
      <div class='line'>And showers of snow-like wind-flowers strown</div>
      <div class='line'>In many a copse and upland lone;</div>
      <div class='line'>Hath heaped on the laburnum gay</div>
      <div class='line'>Its gold—its fragrance on the May;</div>
      <div class='line'>And balls of silver rich to see</div>
      <div class='line'>Hung o’er the wild wayfaring-tree:</div>
      <div class='line'>No wonder that yon ancient hall</div>
      <div class='line'>Looks decked as for a festival.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yon ancient hall!—a noble race,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose deeds hath History loved to trace,</div>
      <div class='line'>Spread yonder court, and raised that tower</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose oriel speaks it Beauty’s bower;</div>
      <div class='line'>And loved in manhood’s youthful pride</div>
      <div class='line'>Through that oak-planted chase to ride,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where antlered roamers brouse and play</div>
      <div class='line'>Throughout the golden summer day;</div>
      <div class='line'>And hares, with eyes like gems that burn,</div>
      <div class='line'>Crouch timid ’mid the rustling fern.</div>
      <div class='line'>Beyond,—a river, clear and blue</div>
      <div class='line'>As Heaven’s own bright cerulean hue,</div>
      <div class='line'>Winds with a song of pleasant tone</div>
      <div class='line'>Through many a meadow-valley lone,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where teeming cows and snowy sheep</div>
      <div class='line'>Along its flowery border creep—</div>
      <div class='line'>And soon as peeps the early Spring,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her merry choir their gladness sing—</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose joy but cheers the soft repose,</div>
      <div class='line'>So fair an English landscape knows.</div>

      <div class='line'>Oft have her childhood’s feet at dawn</div>
      <div class='line'>Brushed its bright dew from yonder lawn,</div>
      <div class='line'>And well she knows each sheltered dell,</div>
      <div class='line'>And each peculiar tree can tell;</div>

      <div class='line'>Few words were said, ere youth and maid</div>
      <div class='line'>A kindred feeling did pervade:</div>
      <div class='line'>Did ever traveller talk so sprightly?</div>
      <div class='line'>Smiled ever Beauty’s eyes so brightly?</div>
      <div class='line'>The mother, with abundant tact</div>
      <div class='line'>The chaperon’s part did well enact,</div>
      <div class='line'>No over-marked desire to please,</div>
      <div class='line'>No feigned reserve—she talked at ease</div>
      <div class='line'>Of climes, and courts, where he had been,</div>
      <div class='line'>With wit and taste, which made it seem</div>
      <div class='line'>That study and reflection taught her,</div>
      <div class='line'>This gives bright promise for her daughter;</div>

      <div class='line'>We tell not Mary’s dreams that night,</div>

      <div class='line'>She thought past doubt, that they should meet,</div>

      <div class='line'>Then gently sighed while counting o’er</div>
      <div class='line'>The hours which must elapse before.</div>
      <div class='line'>At length—at length the clock strikes five,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Mary’s summoned for a drive.</div>
      <div class='line'>She throws by a half-finished sonnet,</div>
      <div class='line'>And blushes as she ties her bonnet,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then smiles as in the glass she sees</div>
      <div class='line'>A face that every eye must please;</div>
      <div class='line'>Each Beau she passes in the street,</div>
      <div class='line'>Causes her timid heart to beat;</div>
      <div class='line'>Afar—she thinks it Deloraine,</div>
      <div class='line'>But near—O hope! why art thou vain?</div>
      <div class='line'>He comes not—an incipient pout</div>
      <div class='line'>Longs to enwreathe her lips about;</div>
      <div class='line'>But her sweet nature conquers spleen,</div>
      <div class='line'>And home returned, there’s something seen,</div>
      <div class='line'>On which her smiles unchecked may fall:</div>
      <div class='line'>His card—she finds it in the hall!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Now at her mirror stands our Mary,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like Cinderella dressed by fairy:</div>
      <div class='line'>A robe, than gossamer more light,</div>

      <div class='line'>She shrunk back from his glowing gaze,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like touch of an enchanter’s wand</div>
      <div class='line'>She felt the farewell of his hand;</div>

      <div class='line'>With him amid the favourite shade</div>
      <div class='line'>Of well-known grove, and woodland glade,</div>

      <div class='line'>Of limpid stream and mountain blue;</div>
      <div class='line'>And feels, the while he fondly speaks,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her native breezes fan her cheeks.</div>
      <div class='line'>They plan—they talk of future schemes,                               <span class='lnum'>}</span></div>

      <div class='line'>Her mother asks—a blush hath flown</div>
      <div class='line'>To her clear cheek—she feels it burn,</div>
      <div class='line'>And redder roses mount in turn.</div>
      <div class='line'>But ere she could an answer frame</div>
      <div class='line'>A troop of ladies round her came;</div>
      <div class='line'>She stops—there hangs on Deloraine’s arm</div>
      <div class='line'>A graceful form; how many a charm</div>
      <div class='line'>Bewitching doth that maid array,</div>
      <div class='line'>And points the pang that will have way,</div>
      <div class='line'>As forced, alas! to pause and see,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her heart grew sick—she wished to be</div>
      <div class='line'>Apart from all that brilliant throng,</div>
      <div class='line'>Apart from smile, and jest, and song:</div>
      <div class='line'>The <em>fête</em> so late all mirth and light,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hath lost its gladness to her sight;</div>
      <div class='line'>The women teaze, the men annoy,</div>
      <div class='line'>The giddy crowd can yield no joy;</div>
      <div class='line'>A tear (that would despite her rise)</div>
      <div class='line'>Sought to escape from her bright eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>As past she saw Lord Deloraine glide</div>
      <div class='line'>With that fair lady at his side.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>O Jealousy! thy serpent fang</div>
      <div class='line'>Strikes through the heart its keenest pang;</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou changest Summer’s sunny air</div>
      <div class='line'>To Winter’s hue of dull despair;</div>
      <div class='line'>The young rose with its radiant bloom,</div>
      <div class='line'>For the wan flower that decks the tomb;</div>
      <div class='line'>And with thy cold insidious art</div>
      <div class='line'>Bidd’st Hope from warmest breast depart.</div>
      <div class='line'>How mused our maid, on every charm</div>
      <div class='line'>Of her who hung on Deloraine’s arm;</div>
      <div class='line'>One minute’s length had been that gaze,</div>
      <div class='line'>But oh! so fraught with wild amaze,</div>
      <div class='line'>A long life it had seemed to be</div>
      <div class='line'>To her excited phantasy.</div>
      <div class='line'>With care she scarcely knew to hide,</div>
      <div class='line'>That beauty how she magnified,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which every eye that both had known</div>
      <div class='line'><em>Must</em> find inferior to her own!</div>
      <div class='line'>That smile, how brightly did it shine,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Ah!” Mary thought, “what chance had mine?”</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet had some fairy made her pass</div>
      <div class='line'>That woman’s shrine—a looking-glass,</div>
      <div class='line'>Even she, all jealous, must have seen</div>
      <div class='line'>Which was of Beauty’s empire Queen:</div>
      <div class='line'>But on she wandered mute and slow—</div>
      <div class='line'>How tedious seemed the revel now!</div>
      <div class='line'>The smiling dandies how she hated,</div>
      <div class='line'>The tiresome chaperons how they prated!</div>
      <div class='line'>“Would it were done!” she sighs once more,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Was ever <em>fête</em> so dull before?”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>An hour—a long, long hour, has flown,</div>
      <div class='line'>A year she thought had fleeter gone,</div>
      <div class='line'>When as her eyes, that wander wide,</div>
      <div class='line'>From the green alley turn aside,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lo! from the lawn Lord Deloraine,</div>
      <div class='line'>With that fair lady, comes again;</div>
      <div class='line'>Some one he seems in haste to seek,</div>
      <div class='line'>And blushes rise to Mary’s cheek,</div>
      <div class='line'>Their glances meet—ah! vain to hide</div>
      <div class='line'>Her gentle joy, as at her side,</div>
      <div class='line'>Eager he takes his wonted place,</div>
      <div class='line'>With rapture beaming in his face;</div>
      <div class='line'>Tells her how vainly, and how long,</div>
      <div class='line'>He sought her ’mid the motley throng;</div>
      <div class='line'>Some witchcraft (what she knows not well),</div>
      <div class='line'>Hath o’er the revel cast a spell;</div>
      <div class='line'>She guesses not what magic wand</div>
      <div class='line'>Restores her back to fairy land,</div>
      <div class='line'>And for those thoughts of saddening strain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Gives back her young bright hopes again.</div>
      <div class='line'>That dreaded rival, it appears,</div>
      <div class='line'>Had Mary’s mother known for years;</div>
      <div class='line'>The two, enchanted at the meeting,</div>
      <div class='line'>Exchange at once the kindest greeting:</div>
      <div class='line'>“<em>So</em> glad!—a sweet surprise! my dear,</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Together now through shady walk</div>
      <div class='line'>And rich parterre they stroll and talk;</div>
      <div class='line'>Mary hath but one grief, alas!</div>
      <div class='line'>That hours will now like moments pass.</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis true no words of love were spoken,</div>
      <div class='line'>But glance and smile, by many a token,</div>
      <div class='line'>Told that the link, which but death parts,</div>

      <div class='line'>In truth, ’twas passing fair to see</div>
      <div class='line'>Mary, with sweet simplicity,</div>
      <div class='line'>Droop her long lashes ’neath his gaze,</div>

      <div class='line'>As childhood’s music, when we meet</div>
      <div class='line'>Its echoes in a stranger land,</div>
      <div class='line'>And wrapt in pensive reverie stand,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dwelling on happy days gone by,</div>
      <div class='line'>Until a tear-drop dews the eye;</div>
      <div class='line'>And well we love that sadness brief,</div>
      <div class='line'>The softness—not the sting of grief,</div>
      <div class='line'>E’en while we sighing ask again</div>
      <div class='line'>To hear that loved and ancient strain.</div>

      <div class='line'>With mind as vacant as the heart,</div>
      <div class='line'>Willing with liberty to part,</div>

      <div class='line'>One month, when hard pressed—what a pity!—</div>
      <div class='line'>He turned his thoughts to the vile city;</div>

      <div class='line'>Old family and wealth for me!</div>
      <div class='line'>A lovely girl—good manners, too.”</div>
      <div class='line'>So once again he did review</div>
      <div class='line'>The season’s list—and Mary saw,</div>
      <div class='line'>A prize he straight would seek to draw.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>He dreamed not she could e’er withstand</div>
      <div class='line'>His thousand merits; well he scanned</div>
      <div class='line'>Her thousand acres—the rent-roll</div>
      <div class='line'>Of her papa quite charmed his soul:</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twas very monstrous that her sire</div>
      <div class='line'>Of life, at fifty, would not tire;</div>
      <div class='line'>Pity, for reasons sound and weighty,</div>
      <div class='line'>They could not push him on to eighty!</div>
      <div class='line'>But still—though not a first-rate catch—                             <span class='lnum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The match would be a decent match,                                   <span class='lnum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>And just his worn-out fortune patch.                                 <span class='lnum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>So, filled with his sublime intent,</div>
      <div class='line'>To see and conquer, forth he went!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Kind were the Fates: it oft befell</div>
      <div class='line'>Lord Squander met our youthful belle,</div>
      <div class='line'>And often to her side he drew,</div>
      <div class='line'>And tender adoration threw</div>
      <div class='line'>Into his eyes—that she might guess,</div>
      <div class='line'>The love it bored him to confess.</div>
      <div class='line'>She heeded not those loving eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor once remarked his frequent sighs;</div>
      <div class='line'>Or if she thought of him again,</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twas but to vote him stupid, vain!</div>
      <div class='line'>A month went by—no progress made!</div>
      <div class='line'>And duns most clamorous to be paid!</div>
      <div class='line'>Urged by his pressing want of cash</div>
      <div class='line'>Our Celadon became more rash,</div>
      <div class='line'>And to explain his purpose better,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bestirred himself, and wrote a letter.</div>
      <div class='line'>A letter such as, well I ween,</div>
      <div class='line'>Few ladies’ eyes have ever seen</div>
      <div class='line'>Self-flatteries laid on so thick;</div>
      <div class='line'>But then the patient was so sick</div>
      <div class='line'>With debt—and with his love intense</div>
      <div class='line'>Was mingled such a confidence;</div>
      <div class='line'>Something like this the letter said,</div>
      <div class='line'>“You, lovely maid, I mean to wed—</div>
      <div class='line'>You’re far too charming, all agree</div>
      <div class='line'>To mate with any one, save me.</div>
      <div class='line'>To spare your blushes, I would rather</div>
      <div class='line'>Arrange the needful with your father:</div>
      <div class='line'>This done—though half the world may wonder,</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ll prove myself your faithful Squander!”</div>
      <div class='line'>Signed—sealed—the letter was despatched:</div>
      <div class='line'>The writer yawned, “At last I’m matched!”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>No fears had he—in half an hour</div>
      <div class='line'>His homage entered Mary’s bower,</div>
      <div class='line'>A place unmeet for words of folly;</div>
      <div class='line'>They found her thoughtful—melancholy.</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twas yet unopened—and a hue</div>
      <div class='line'>Of crimson to her soft cheek flew,</div>
      <div class='line'>By Love’s own instinct half-deceived,</div>
      <div class='line'>She paused, she trembled, and believed</div>
      <div class='line'>The thing she hoped—she broke the seal,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sure that the letter must reveal</div>
      <div class='line'>Lord Deloraine’s love, which though full well</div>
      <div class='line'>She knew, she longed to have him tell.</div>
      <div class='line'>But angry as Idalia’s Queen,</div>
      <div class='line'>If, bent on journey, she had seen</div>
      <div class='line'>Her doves towards haunts forbidden wander,</div>
      <div class='line'>When she beheld the name of Squander</div>
      <div class='line'>She stood one instant lost in rage,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then cast away th’ audacious page;</div>
      <div class='line'>She scarcely could the insult bear,</div>
      <div class='line'>That such a brainless fop should dare</div>
      <div class='line'>Address her thus—then once again</div>
      <div class='line'>Thought wistfully of Deloraine.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Struggling with shame she scarce could smother,</div>
      <div class='line'>She gave the letter to her mother;</div>
      <div class='line'>The Lady Percy spared her ire:</div>
      <div class='line'>“What! that known <em>roué</em>?—<em>He</em> aspire</div>
      <div class='line'>To win my child, whom best of men</div>
      <div class='line'>Might scarce deserve? Be quick! a pen!</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ll write a proper answer now!”</div>
      <div class='line'>And, ere the flush passed from her brow,</div>
      <div class='line'>A proud rejection sent to Squander,</div>
      <div class='line'>Set that brave youth agape with wonder;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, while he gapes, the ghosts of bets,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dishonoured bills, rapacious debts,</div>
      <div class='line'>In a long line before him come,</div>
      <div class='line'>That stretches out “till crack of doom:”</div>
      <div class='line'>“Well, there’s no choice! and I <em>must</em> pity</div>
      <div class='line'>Some golden Venus of the City!”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Were I a gossip, I could tell</div>
      <div class='line'>Of other suitors to our Belle:</div>
      <div class='line'>One—Sir George Vapid, hearing praised</div>
      <div class='line'>Her wondrous beauty—half-amazed</div>
      <div class='line'>Out of his slumbers—felt the praise,</div>
      <div class='line'>Somewhat like love, a <em>penchant</em> raise;</div>
      <div class='line'>Not in his heart, but in his brain,</div>
      <div class='line'>For he was artless, cold, and vain,</div>
      <div class='line'>And ne’er till doomsday had desired</div>
      <div class='line'>To win a beauty few admired.</div>
      <div class='line'>Had Hebe’s self come down to snare</div>
      <div class='line'>The experienced youth of proud May Fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>He’d but have owned <em>her</em> goddess when</div>
      <div class='line'>A goddess owned her other men.</div>
      <div class='line'>And thus it is—the word t’ admire,</div>
      <div class='line'>Through Fashion’s circles runs like fire;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nine out of ten, my Muse believes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus pin their taste on others’ sleeves!</div>
      <div class='line'>And so, with no more sapient reason,</div>
      <div class='line'>He sought the Beauty of the Season.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Needs it to tell how soon his wooing,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like my Lord Squander’s, went to ruin?</div>
      <div class='line'>The self-same pen—as proud, as rapid—</div>
      <div class='line'>His answer gave to Sir George Vapid.</div>
      <div class='line'>Great was his wonder, his dejection</div>
      <div class='line'>Gave birth for once to cool reflection:</div>
      <div class='line'>“There’s some one else, I clearly see,</div>
      <div class='line'>Will carry off this prodigy—</div>
      <div class='line'>I should have liked the gem to wear,</div>
      <div class='line'>And make my friends at Crockford’s stare!”</div>
      <div class='line'>Hail, Envy! thou their choicest bliss,</div>
      <div class='line'>Givest, by rebound, to fools like this!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Now change the scene, for one more gay!</div>
      <div class='line'>At least, so Lords and Ladies say;</div>
      <div class='line'>The maiden’s chamber fades in air,</div>
      <div class='line'>And with its sparkle and its glare,</div>
      <div class='line'>And music’s ever-witching spell,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Opera wooes our youthful Belle.</div>
      <div class='line'>For many a wise and cogent reason,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Lady Percy had each season</div>
      <div class='line'>An opera box; yet, though no prude,</div>
      <div class='line'>Suspicious doubt would now intrude,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whether ’twas right her virgin treasure</div>
      <div class='line'>Should share that fascinating pleasure?</div>
      <div class='line'>She scarcely knows what she intends,</div>
      <div class='line'>And hints her scruples to her friends;</div>
      <div class='line'>But all, inured to play and <em>ballet</em>,</div>
      <div class='line'>With many a pleasantry did rally</div>
      <div class='line'>The fears which in the mother woke:</div>
      <div class='line'>“How very odd!—’twas quite a joke!</div>
      <div class='line'>Why, all young ladies, when presented,</div>
      <div class='line'>That harmless paradise frequented.</div>
      <div class='line'>What is it you can see alarming?</div>
      <div class='line'>Not the Cachoucha?—that’s <em>so</em> charming!”</div>
      <div class='line'>“My daughters, though they sometimes flush,”</div>
      <div class='line'>Quoth one high dame, “did never blush—</div>
      <div class='line'>Not even in their earliest teens:</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ve got a box beneath the Queen’s.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Such sapient rhetoric laughed down all</div>
      <div class='line'>The reasons <i><span lang="fr">Madame Mère</span></i> could call</div>
      <div class='line'>For, or against; and, thus persuaded,</div>
      <div class='line'>Mary, she said, should do as they did—</div>
      <div class='line'>The glories of the opera see,</div>
      <div class='line'>And learn to <em>speak</em> with ecstasy,</div>
      <div class='line'>As Grisi, like a summer bird,</div>
      <div class='line'>Poured forth the tones, while none who heard</div>
      <div class='line'>Had pity wherewithal to note</div>
      <div class='line'>How much the siren strained her throat.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The night is come—and now to eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>Behold the scarlet curtain rise,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which never novel’s page had read,</div>
      <div class='line'>But history, voyages, instead,</div>
      <div class='line'>With lives of great and virtuous men,</div>
      <div class='line'>Such as a Plutarch loved to pen;</div>
      <div class='line'>For poetry the maid had pleaded,</div>
      <div class='line'>And but enjoyed it—wisely weeded:</div>
      <div class='line'>Little she dreamed, how much less knew,</div>
      <div class='line'>What things Italian play-wrights do!</div>
      <div class='line'>Judge then—to make her entrance easy,</div>
      <div class='line'>The piece was “Norma,” played by Grisi!</div>
      <div class='line'>A Priestess breaking vestal vows,</div>
      <div class='line'>A mother twice—not once a spouse:</div>
      <div class='line'>All frenetic with jealous rage,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which nought but vengeance can assuage,</div>
      <div class='line'>Grasping a keen and murderous dagger,</div>
      <div class='line'>To yon low couch behold her stagger,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where sleep her babes:—but love prevails,</div>
      <div class='line'>The mother stays—the murderess fails!</div>
      <div class='line'>When this dark picture Mary saw</div>
      <div class='line'>She trembled—scarcely dared to draw</div>
      <div class='line'>Her breath—the while Bellini stole</div>
      <div class='line'>With magic witchery through her soul,</div>
      <div class='line'>And tears relieved her; then there came</div>
      <div class='line'>O’er her young brow the blush of shame.</div>
      <div class='line'>Around she timid glanced her eye,</div>
      <div class='line'>But none looked shocked, and none looked shy;</div>
      <div class='line'>Faces, as youthful as her own,</div>
      <div class='line'>Were placid all—nor there were shewn</div>
      <div class='line'>The feelings wakened in <em>her</em> breast,</div>
      <div class='line'>By Norma’s love and shame confessed!</div>
      <div class='line'>The curtain falls—the horror’s o’er,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Mary calmer breathes once more!</div>

      <div class='line'>And thinking men must sure be frantic</div>
      <div class='line'>Who patronised such postures antic;</div>
      <div class='line'>She felt abashed to meet the eye</div>
      <div class='line'>Of every fop that loitered by:</div>
      <div class='line'>And, oh! how rudely did it vex</div>
      <div class='line'>Her fresh, pure heart, to mark her sex</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus outraged, while the noblest came</div>
      <div class='line'>To gaze and revel in their shame.</div>
      <div class='line'>Her troubled look the mother saw,</div>
      <div class='line'>And rose all-pitying, to withdraw,</div>
      <div class='line'>Convinced such shows must pain dispense</div>
      <div class='line'>To one bred up in innocence.</div>
      <div class='line'>But there was one who joyed to see</div>
      <div class='line'>The pure and shrinking modesty</div>
      <div class='line'>Of this fair girl—’twas Deloraine!</div>
      <div class='line'>Ah! stands he at her side again?</div>

      <div class='line'>As droop poor Nattier’s faded flowers,</div>

      <div class='line'>The men behold the altered faces</div>
      <div class='line'>Of belles who stood in their good graces;</div>

      <div class='line'>For, half-suspecting she’s a fright,</div>
      <div class='line'>She tries to set her toilette right;</div>
      <div class='line'>And lisps, “I hope <em>your</em> horse will win,”</div>
      <div class='line'>To every beau that enters in:</div>
      <div class='line'>While man, the gentler sex forgetting,</div>

      <div class='line'>Who’ll tell them all when next he’s mellow.</div>
      <div class='line'>To mingle with this herd of men,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who thought of nought but horses then,</div>
      <div class='line'>Our Mary felt was not her place,</div>
      <div class='line'>And took no pleasure in the race.</div>
      <div class='line'>But when she marked the women bet,</div>

      <div class='line'>With flushing cheek, and sparkling eye,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whene’er a favourite’s horse they spy,</div>
      <div class='line'>And talked of odds to give or take,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Handicap, Match, or Sweepstake,</div>
      <div class='line'>And saw their dainty fingers hold</div>
      <div class='line'>Purses in which shone coins of gold,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ready to pay in case of loss,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though e’en the notion made them cross;</div>
      <div class='line'>Or heard them eager claim the cash</div>
      <div class='line'>Won from the losers, young and rash;</div>
      <div class='line'>She marked the scene with sad surprise,</div>

      <div class='line'>With cries of blacklegs offering bets;</div>
      <div class='line'>Shrill flutes, and shriller pipes of Pan,</div>
      <div class='line'>And songs deserving censor’s ban;</div>
      <div class='line'>“The horses, and their owners’ names,”</div>
      <div class='line'>At every side some knave proclaims;</div>
      <div class='line'>And cries of “Dorling’s genuine card,”</div>
      <div class='line'>From lungs stentorian ceaseless heard;</div>
      <div class='line'>While thimbleriggers boors entice,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sharpers others tempt with dice;</div>
      <div class='line'>And execrations, loud and deep,</div>
      <div class='line'>Are heard, as disappears the heap</div>
      <div class='line'>Of coins of silver and of brass,</div>
      <div class='line'>Won from the coffers of each ass;</div>
      <div class='line'>And countless beggars ply their trade,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whom practice long hath perfect made;</div>
      <div class='line'>And gipsy, chattering like a witch,</div>
      <div class='line'>Foretells weak maidens husbands rich,</div>
      <div class='line'>Prates of dark women and fair men,</div>
      <div class='line'>Begs you’ll but cross her hands, and then</div>
      <div class='line'>She’ll straight reveal your future fate,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whether a coffin or a mate:</div>
      <div class='line'>These mingled sounds produce such din,</div>
      <div class='line'>That Mary feels, a realm to win,</div>
      <div class='line'>Again she’d not a race-course see,</div>
      <div class='line'>And longed—how longed—at home to be!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And now the racers are led out,</div>
      <div class='line'>And quick disperse the rabble rout;</div>
      <div class='line'>The generous steeds impatient stand,</div>
      <div class='line'>While held in by their trainers’ hand:</div>
      <div class='line'>Their coats how sleek, their limbs how fine!</div>
      <div class='line'>England, what coursers equal thine?</div>
      <div class='line'>The Jockeys, too, how trim, how neat!</div>
      <div class='line'>How light each hand, how firm each seat!</div>
      <div class='line'>The signal’s given, they start a pace</div>
      <div class='line'>That promises a well-fought race:</div>
      <div class='line'>They quicker move—now quicker still,</div>
      <div class='line'>Round Tottenham Corner; see what skill</div>
      <div class='line'>Each Jockey shews to save his horse!</div>
      <div class='line'>Now rapidly along the course</div>
      <div class='line'>They dart, like arrows from the bow,</div>
      <div class='line'>And keep so near, that none can know</div>
      <div class='line'>Which is the fleetest. Side by side,</div>
      <div class='line'>The pink and yellow rapid glide;</div>
      <div class='line'>They’re neck to neck: how far behind</div>
      <div class='line'>The rest are left!—swift as the wind</div>
      <div class='line'>They fly. Now yellow dashes past</div>
      <div class='line'>The pink—the leader’s now the last!</div>
      <div class='line'>The yellow keeps a-head: he’ll win—</div>
      <div class='line'>He nears the goal—“He’s in! he’s in!”</div>
      <div class='line'>A deaf’ning shout now rends the air;                                 <span class='lnum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The winners laugh, the losers swear,                                 <span class='lnum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Whose feeling wives their salts prepare.                             <span class='lnum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>How pallid look their cheeks and brows!</div>
      <div class='line'>How sullen seems each beaten spouse,</div>
      <div class='line'>Reflecting he must soon “book up,”</div>
      <div class='line'>And leave the victor, gold, and cup!</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A luncheon next the Stand supplies,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where chickens, <em>pâtés</em>, lamb, cold pies,</div>

      <div class='line'>Devoured, till appetite doth pall;</div>
      <div class='line'>And soda-water, and champagne,</div>
      <div class='line'>Restore the losers’ nerves again.</div>
      <div class='line'>Those who, less favoured, find no place</div>
      <div class='line'>In the Grand Stand to see the race,</div>
      <div class='line'>Feast on their dickeys, or in carriage;</div>
      <div class='line'>And hungry gazers can’t disparage</div>
      <div class='line'>Their appetites, when e’en the fair</div>

      <div class='line'>Thy influence, brisk champagne! bespeak.</div>
      <div class='line'>How glad was Mary, when, all over,</div>
      <div class='line'>Seated beside her ardent lover,</div>
      <div class='line'>She heard her mother, with remorse,</div>
      <div class='line'>Regret the hours lost at the Course;</div>
      <div class='line'>And soon forgetting all around</div>
      <div class='line'>Her mind its native quiet found.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Time flew on gay and airy wing,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Summer had replaced the Spring;</div>
      <div class='line'>No more in the street and square were seen,</div>
      <div class='line'>The trees beclad in mantle green,</div>
      <div class='line'>For now exhausted, dusty, brown,</div>
      <div class='line'>They wore the livery of the town.</div>
      <div class='line'>The grass, wherever grass was seen,</div>
      <div class='line'>Resembled nought save washed nankeen;</div>
      <div class='line'>The shrubs, in spite of gardener’s care,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hung their limp boughs with dying air;</div>
      <div class='line'>No more the sickly window-roses</div>
      <div class='line'>Had strength to charm the inmates’ noses;</div>
      <div class='line'>And balconies in every street</div>
      <div class='line'>With mignonette so lately sweet,</div>
      <div class='line'>(A melancholy sight indeed!)</div>
      <div class='line'>Shewed their whole treasure run to seed.</div>
      <div class='line'>Now to the plague of mortal eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>Began the carnival of flies;</div>
      <div class='line'>All London, still of Fashion full,</div>

      <div class='line'>And pretty lips, with smiles that shone,</div>

      <div class='line'>Viewing with dread the time approach,</div>
      <div class='line'>When, packed in the ancestral coach,</div>

      <div class='line'>With long and dreary months in view!</div>
      <div class='line'>Autumn and Winter spent at home,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where but old stupid neighbours come—</div>
      <div class='line'>The Rector and his prosy madam,</div>

      <div class='line'>Poor things! devoured with earnest passion</div>
      <div class='line'>To know and ape the newest fashion—</div>

      <div class='line'>Than bid adieu to dear May Fair?                                     <span class='lnum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Now mothers, too, with <em>soirées</em> sated,</div>

      <div class='line'>Are left—(the beaux all fled away),</div>

      <div class='line'>At times depressed, at times elate,</div>
      <div class='line'>He now would dare, and meet his fate.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>There came a splendid carnival,</div>
      <div class='line'>The season’s last—a costume ball;</div>
      <div class='line'>And called, as if by wizard’s wand,</div>
      <div class='line'>In garbs of many a distant land:</div>
      <div class='line'>To grace that gorgeous revel came,</div>
      <div class='line'>A host of charms—ah! who could name</div>
      <div class='line'>One half the beauty, rich and bright,</div>
      <div class='line'>That shone on that last revel night?</div>
      <div class='line'>There many a youthful matron bore</div>
      <div class='line'>Her store of gems—and sighed for more,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yon fair Sultana to eclipse</div>
      <div class='line'>With henna on her fingers’ tips;</div>
      <div class='line'>There in a snowy veil entangled</div>
      <div class='line'>Drooped pensive Nun; and next, half-strangled</div>
      <div class='line'>By garland, Perdita the fair,—</div>
      <div class='line'>And an Ophelia, with a stare</div>
      <div class='line'>Of wonder, as she queried whether</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twas right to wear the heron feather,</div>
      <div class='line'>That nodded, with each Scottish breath,</div>
      <div class='line'>On her who stood for Queen Macbeth?</div>
      <div class='line'>In truth it was a pleasant sight</div>
      <div class='line'>To meet, in noon-tide blaze of light,</div>
      <div class='line'>The denizens of furthest lands,</div>
      <div class='line'>From Asia’s shores to Egypt’s sands:</div>
      <div class='line'>There prudes, with shrinking horror, saw</div>
      <div class='line'>The beads and blanket of a Squaw;</div>
      <div class='line'>But ere their whispered blame began                                  <span class='lnum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>To circle round, a murmur ran,                                       <span class='lnum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>“How very droll!—a nice young man!”                                  <span class='lnum'>}</span></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>There fair young Greeks in freedom strayed,</div>
      <div class='line'>With braided locks, and robes that played</div>
      <div class='line'>In many a light and graceful fold,</div>
      <div class='line'>And white brows bound with coins of gold;</div>
      <div class='line'>The Turkish fair unveiled were then</div>
      <div class='line'>To the promiscuous gaze of men,</div>
      <div class='line'>With such a wealth of raven hair,</div>
      <div class='line'>And cheeks so radiant, brows so fair—</div>
      <div class='line'>No wonder Sultans, passing nigh,</div>
      <div class='line'>Eyed the fair groups, and wished to buy!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>One dame—a daring feat I ween,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wore the rich robes of Scotland’s Queen,</div>
      <div class='line'>And loud, and long, was heard to sigh                                <span class='lnum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Whenever stately glided by,                                          <span class='lnum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>In harsh and formal Majesty,                                         <span class='lnum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Her rival, with a well-starched ruff,</div>
      <div class='line'>And robe of grand brocaded stuff.</div>
      <div class='line'>There Anna Boleyn smiled elate</div>
      <div class='line'>Defying her approaching fate;</div>
      <div class='line'>So blithe she looked, the wise ones said</div>
      <div class='line'>Before her time she’d lost her head:</div>
      <div class='line'>While bluff King Harry, following after,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thought her much younger than her daughter.</div>
      <div class='line'>And she, the serious, sweet Jane Gray,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who better loved to read than play—</div>
      <div class='line'>As Ascham tells us—danced as though</div>
      <div class='line'>She took much pleasure in the show;</div>
      <div class='line'>There with mantilla, flower, and fan,</div>
      <div class='line'>And saucy page behind who ran,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sour duenna in a hoop,</div>
      <div class='line'>Came Spanish maids, a haughty group;</div>
      <div class='line'>Behind them close, with charming song,</div>
      <div class='line'>Did three Tyrolean sisters throng;</div>
      <div class='line'>And in the <em>chaine</em>, a Croat did turn</div>
      <div class='line'>A pretty black-capped maid of Berne;</div>
      <div class='line'>Three Nuns demure—pressed hard by railers,</div>
      <div class='line'>(Fresh-water though) a pair of Sailors;</div>
      <div class='line'>A Hollandaise, contrasted well</div>
      <div class='line'>With a Savoyard—his <em>vielle</em></div>
      <div class='line'>Slung at his back—and when he played,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ye Gods! what doleful noise he made!</div>
      <div class='line'>And Naples sent her peasants there,</div>
      <div class='line'>With sparkling eyes, and jetty hair,</div>
      <div class='line'>And dresses dight with colours gay</div>
      <div class='line'>Such as at <em>festas</em> they display:</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus, once resistless, moved along</div>
      <div class='line'>Bright MALIBRAN, that queen of song!</div>
      <div class='line'>They little thought, who passed her by,</div>
      <div class='line'>And marvelled at her mirthful eye,</div>
      <div class='line'>So full of life and joy was she,</div>
      <div class='line'>That soon the tomb her home must be!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And Roman Ladies, chaste and proud,</div>
      <div class='line'>Were mingled in that motley crowd;</div>
      <div class='line'>And witching gipsies fortunes told,</div>
      <div class='line'>The same one theme, to young and old;</div>
      <div class='line'>And Pilgrims with their cockle-shells;</div>
      <div class='line'>And Folly with his cap and bells;</div>
      <div class='line'>And Comus with his cup divine;</div>
      <div class='line'>And Circe, but without her swine;</div>
      <div class='line'>And she who on the willowy shore<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c008'><sup>[2]</sup></a>                                  <span class='lnum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Of Carthage, did her love deplore;—                                  <span class='lnum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>The Muse lacks breath: she can no more.                              <span class='lnum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Through the vast hall the brilliant crowd</div>
      <div class='line'>Roamed gaily, or to music loud</div>
      <div class='line'>Whirled nimble feet, while some apart,</div>
      <div class='line'>Revealed soft secrets of the heart:</div>
      <div class='line'>Full many a fair and dimpled lisper</div>
      <div class='line'>Lent her white ear to Flattery’s whisper,</div>
      <div class='line'>And though in Love’s experience read,</div>
      <div class='line'>Believed the whole the coxcomb said:</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twas almost true—if true not quite—</div>
      <div class='line'>And who could doubt on such a night?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Who on this brilliant scene had dwelt,</div>
      <div class='line'>And paused to think, but must have felt</div>
      <div class='line'>As Xerxes, when he wept to see                                       <span class='lnum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>That mighty, moving throng, whom he                                  <span class='lnum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>Had marshalled on to destiny,                                        <span class='lnum'>}</span></div>
      <div class='line'>This crowd of young, and blithe, and fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>Smiled on by Death—but not to spare?</div>
      <div class='line'>To his wan eye, the gilded room</div>
      <div class='line'>Is but a thickly peopled tomb;</div>
      <div class='line'>To him the years are but a day,</div>
      <div class='line'>That pass, and all have gone their way,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or, touched by Time with finger cold,</div>
      <div class='line'>Are frail, and spectral to behold:</div>
      <div class='line'>He laughs at every polished brow,</div>
      <div class='line'>And floating tress, and neck of snow,</div>
      <div class='line'>And cheek that shames the rarest rose,</div>
      <div class='line'>And lips that rows of pearl disclose;</div>
      <div class='line'>And forms from Beauty’s faultless mould,</div>
      <div class='line'>So softly fair or proudly bold,</div>
      <div class='line'>That seraphs, from their amaranth bowers,</div>
      <div class='line'>Might envy shapes this earth of ours</div>
      <div class='line'>Yields from its dust;—and while he quaffs</div>
      <div class='line'>His wine of tears, the Spoiler laughs,</div>
      <div class='line'>Too soon that shadowy wand to wave,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which sweeps the revellers to the grave!</div>
      <div class='line'>But O! how few e’er pause to think,</div>
      <div class='line'>While Pleasure’s cup, filled to the brink,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lures them to taste—and idly gay,</div>
      <div class='line'>Their brief existence sport away;</div>
      <div class='line'>Until, perchance, some dear one dies,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then falls the bandage from their eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>That hid the dread truth from their gaze,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, terror-struck, in wild amaze</div>
      <div class='line'>They learn that nought of man’s endeavour</div>
      <div class='line'>Can change the doom—“Ye part for ever!”</div>
      <div class='line'>For ever?—No—in realms on high,</div>
      <div class='line'>If the heart’s instinct prove no lie&#160;...</div>
      <div class='line'>But pause—nor trench on themes divine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Unmeet for such light lay as mine.</div>

      <div class='line'>Jointure in case of widowhood—</div>
      <div class='line'>Nay, so o’er-provident were they,</div>
      <div class='line'>As with shred counsel long to weigh</div>
      <div class='line'>What sum, in case of separation,</div>
      <div class='line'>Should form the lady’s reparation.</div>
      <div class='line'>The youth to fancy did begin</div>
      <div class='line'>That Time stood still in Lincoln’s Inn;</div>
      <div class='line'>He’d wait no more, but spoke aloud,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, angry with impatience, vowed</div>

      <div class='line'>Cold to his prayers, those parchment men</div>
      <div class='line'>The pin-money must settle then.</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But all, at last, was finished well.</div>
      <div class='line'>Now of the thousand gifts to tell</div>

      <div class='line'>Diamonds, the costliest and the rarest;</div>
      <div class='line'>Pearls of the East, the largest, fairest—</div>
      <div class='line'>How proud had Egypt’s royal Queen,</div>

      <div class='line'>When earth he latest looks upon;</div>
      <div class='line'>Emeralds, whose deep and lucid green,</div>

      <div class='line'>As rainbows shew in Summer skies,</div>
      <div class='line'>Were showered on her, whose beauty rare,</div>

      <div class='line'>And many a maiden’s tempted eye</div>

      <div class='line'>For one brief instant, tearful, fond,</div>
      <div class='line'>She does not view the home beyond,</div>

Queen of Sheba submitted for consideration to Solomon the Wise took
the form of a couple of wreaths—the one of natural, the other of
artificial flowers. The monarch, unable to decide between nature and
art, called in the aid of a swarm of bees, which, by settling upon
the genuine wreath, saved the King of Judah’s reputation for wisdom.</p>
